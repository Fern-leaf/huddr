### Paths and hierarchies

### How to unzip a file/folder

-   To make large files easier to transfer we can compress them (zip them). These files will need to be unzipped before you can use the content inside. this can be done 2 ways. the first way is by entering the zipped file and pressing the unzip button in the tip right corner. the next way is to right click on the zipped folder before entering it and clicking on unzip from the menu.

### How to move/copy files from one folder to another

-   Moving a file removes it from the origin location whereas copying the file duplicates it meaning there i a copy at the origin and destination.
-   Click on the file you want to move to highlight it. then click on the file again and drag it to the side panel, you can put the file in the new folder by releasing the mouse button. if the place you want to put your file is within a folder you can hover over the folder on the sidebar and it will open. To copy a file you can click on the file and either press the copy button at the top of the screen o use the shortcut CTRL+C then go into the folder you want the file to be in and pressing the paste button at the top of the screen or using the shortcut CTRL+V. Copy and paste can also be done by right clicking on the file and selecting copy and then right clicking on the blank space in the destination folder and selecting paste.
